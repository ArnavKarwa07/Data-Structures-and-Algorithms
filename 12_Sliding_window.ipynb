    "# Sliding Window Technique in Python/DSA\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sliding window** is a powerful technique used to solve problems involving arrays or lists, especially when you need to find subarrays or substrings that satisfy certain conditions (like maximum sum, minimum length, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Window:** A contiguous subset of elements within the array/list.\n",
    "- **Sliding:** Move the window forward by adding the next element and removing the previous one, instead of recalculating for every possible subarray.\n",
    "- **Types:**\n",
    "    - **Fixed-size window:** The window size remains constant (e.g., find the max sum of any subarray of size `k`).\n",
    "    - **Variable-size window:** The window size changes based on the problem's constraints (e.g., smallest subarray with sum ≥ `S`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in Sliding Window Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize pointers:** Usually two pointers (`start`, `end`) to represent the window's boundaries.\n",
    "2. **Expand the window:** Move the `end` pointer to include new elements.\n",
    "3. **Shrink the window:** Move the `start` pointer to exclude elements when certain conditions are met.\n",
    "4. **Track the result:** Update the answer as the window slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Avoids redundant calculations by reusing previous computations.\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** Reduces nested loops to a single loop, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time and Space Complexities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "    - Typically **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array/list. Each element is processed at most twice (once when entering and once when leaving the window).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:**  \n",
    "    - Usually **O(1)** for fixed-size windows (constant extra space).\n",
    "    - Can be **O(k)** or more for variable-size windows if additional data structures (like hash maps or sets) are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum/minimum sum subarray of size `k`\n",
    "- Longest substring with unique characters\n",
    "- Smallest subarray with a sum greater than a target\n",
    "- Counting occurrences of anagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "The sliding window technique is essential for optimizing problems involving subarrays or substrings. It reduces time complexity from O(n²) (brute force) to O(n) in most cases, with minimal extra space."
