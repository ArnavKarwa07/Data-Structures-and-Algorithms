    "# Dynamic Programming (DP) in Python/Data Structures & Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Dynamic Programming?\n",
    "Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem has **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure** properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overlapping Subproblems:** The problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times.\n",
    "- **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Top-Down (Memoization)**\n",
    "- Recursively solve subproblems and store their results to avoid redundant computations.\n",
    "- Uses extra space for the memoization table (usually a dictionary or array).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**\n",
    "- Iteratively solve all subproblems starting from the smallest, building up to the solution.\n",
    "- Uses a table (usually an array) to store results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Solve a DP Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the subproblem.**\n",
    "2. **Write the recurrence relation.**\n",
    "3. **Identify base cases.**\n",
    "4. **Choose memoization or tabulation.**\n",
    "5. **Implement and optimize.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time and Space Complexities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**  \n",
    "    - Usually O(n), O(n²), or O(n³) depending on the number of subproblems and the time to solve each.\n",
    "    - DP reduces exponential time (O(2ⁿ)) to polynomial time in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:**  \n",
    "    - O(n), O(n²), etc., depending on the size of the memoization/table.\n",
    "    - Can often be optimized to O(1) or O(n) by only storing necessary states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fibonacci Sequence**\n",
    "- **Knapsack Problem**\n",
    "- **Longest Common Subsequence**\n",
    "- **Edit Distance**\n",
    "- **Coin Change**\n",
    "- **Matrix Chain Multiplication**\n",
    "- **Subset Sum**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use DP\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "- When the problem exhibits optimal substructure.\n",
    "- When brute-force or recursion leads to redundant calculations.\n",
