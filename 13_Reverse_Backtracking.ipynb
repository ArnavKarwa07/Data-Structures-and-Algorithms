    "# Backtracking and Recursive Backtracking in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Backtracking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It builds candidates to the solutions incrementally and abandons a candidate (\"backtracks\") as soon as it determines the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive approach**: Uses recursion to explore all possibilities\n",
    "- **Constraint satisfaction**: Prunes branches that violate constraints\n",
    "- **State exploration**: Builds partial solutions step by step\n",
    "- **Systematic search**: Explores the solution space exhaustively but efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Recursion Works in Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Base Case: Check if current state is a valid solution\n",
    "2. Recursive Case: Try all possible next moves\n",
    "3. Explore: Recursively solve for each valid move\n",
    "4. Backtrack: Undo the move and try alternatives\n",
    "5. Return: Return when solution is found or all options exhausted\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Backtracking Problems\n",

    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **N-Queens** | Place N queens on chessboard with no conflicts |\n",
    "| **Sudoku Solver** | Fill grid following Sudoku rules |\n",
    "| **Permutations/Combinations** | Generate all possible arrangements |\n",
    "| **Word Search** | Find words in a 2D grid |\n",
    "| **Rat in Maze** | Find path from start to exit |\n",
    "| **Subset Sum** | Find subsets with target sum |\n",

    "## Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Worst Case**: **O(N!)** to **O(2^N)** depending on problem\n",
    "    - N! for permutation problems\n",
    "    - 2^N for subset/combination problems\n",
    "    - Problem-dependent for constraint satisfaction\n",
    "- **Best Case**: **O(1)** if solution found immediately\n",
    "- **Average Case**: Depends on pruning effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursion Stack**: **O(N)** or **O(depth)** for call stack\n",
    "- **Additional Space**: Depends on storing candidates/results\n",
    "- **Total**: **O(N + S)** where S is space for storing results\n",
    "    - N: depth of recursion tree\n",
    "    - S: space for solutions stored\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Generating Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Complexity |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|\n",
    "| Time | O(N × N!) |\n",
    "| Space | O(N) recursion depth + O(N!) for output |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Generating Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Complexity |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|\n",
    "| Time | O(N × 2^N) |\n",
    "| Space | O(N) recursion depth + O(2^N) for output |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pruning**: Cut branches early that can't lead to solutions\n",
    "2. **Memoization**: Cache results of subproblems\n",
    "3. **Constraint Checking**: Verify constraints before exploring\n",
    "4. **Heuristics**: Use problem-specific insights to guide search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backtracking Template in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def backtrack(path, candidates):\n",
    "        # Base case\n",
    "        if is_solution(path):\n",
    "                result.append(path[:])\n",
    "                return\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Try each candidate\n",
    "        for candidate in candidates:\n",
    "                if is_valid(candidate, path):\n",
    "                        path.append(candidate)\n",
    "                        backtrack(path, remaining_candidates)\n",
    "                        path.pop()  # Backtrack\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: Backtracking is powerful for exploring solution spaces where multiple choices exist at each step, with effectiveness depending on how well constraints prune invalid branches."
